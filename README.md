# csvParser

- [x] Build a sequential CSV file parser
- [x] Parser for Numbers (ints, floats, etc), Dates, Strings and custom parser for structures and enums
- [x] Geting offsets of members, strides of buffer and types of values to be parsed from CSV from user and place them in user defined structs
- [ ] Write few examples
- [ ] Generate / write documentation

## Examples to code
1. Using serial parsing by printing in table
2. Using serializer to parse structs with not complex types
3. Using custom parser functions to parse complex types such as array / structs
4. Examples of replacing std library function, only allocation functions
5. Examples by loading file and reading by ourself instead of using the function that automatically loads the file and parses it
